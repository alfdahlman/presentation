# Devs :heart: design: #2 Get started with Web Development

## Introduction

This session is an introduction to web development and explores the basic concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
You will also get to try out some of these concepts on your own. By the end of this session, you will
have a better understanding of web development, and hopefully the interest to keep exploring on your own.

## HTML

HTML, _Hyper Text Markup Language_, is a markup language used to structure content on the web. It defines elements using tags, like `<div>` or `<paragraph>`.
A HTML document consist of two main parts:

- `<head>`: Contains metadata, links to scripts and styles, and page info for the browser.
- `<body>`: Contains the actual content visible to the user.

A HTML document could be as simple as:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My first website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>A heading...</h1>
    <p>...and a paragraph</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Opening this file in a browser yields your very first webpage. :tada:

### DOM

When a browser loads an HTML document, it builds a tree-like structure in memory, called the **DOM** (Document Object Model).

The DOM is a live, dynamic representation of the HTML, allowing scripts to read and manipulate the page after its loaded.

> To inspect the DOM of a webpage, open the `Developer tools` in your browser, and select the `Elements` tab.

## CSS

**CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets), is used to style the HTML content. Modern browsers (mostly) interpret CSS the same way, allowing us to write styles that looks the same across different browsers.

To apply styles, you select elements using a _selector_, and define the _style_ to apply.

```
h1 {
    color: red;
}
```

In this example, all `<h1>` elements will have the color red.

If you need more control, you can use **classes**.

```
.red {
    color: red;
}
```

CSS reads from top to bottom, with the later rule winning. But it also uses a **specificity scoring system**. For example, selecting a `.class` is more specific than selecting a `tag`.

There are two common ways to include css:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Inline Style">
    ```
    <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
      <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8" />
       <title>page title</title>
      </head>
      <body>
       <style>
        h1 {
          color: red;
        }
        </style>
        <h1>A heading</h1>
      </body>
     </html>
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linked Stylesheet">
   ```
    <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8" />
       <title>page title</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
     </head>
     <body>
      <h1>A heading</h1>
     </body>
    </html>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Try it out...

Try styling this HTML using CSS:

- make the heading red
- make the first paragraph green
- make the second paragraph blue.

```
   <h1>Heading</h1>
    <p class="first">first paragraph</p>
    <p class="second">second paragraph</p>
```

<Playground
  lang="css"
  html="<h1>Heading</h1><p class='first'>first paragraph</p><p class='second'>second paragraph</p>"
/>

## JavaScript

_JavaScript_ is a programming language which can run in the browser and lets you add interactivity to web pages.

HTML defines structure, CSS handles appearance, and JavaScript handles behavior like responding to user clicks, fetching data, or updating content.

Modern browsers expose a set of standardized APIs that JavaScript can use to interact with the page. This includes working with the DOM, making network requests, and much more.

To include javascript on the page, you can either inline it of link it.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Inline script">
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Page title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <script>
      console.log('Inline script')
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Linked script">
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Page title</title>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Accessing the DOM

You can use the `document` object (part of the browser’s window object) to access and modify the DOM.

Example:

```
const h1 = document.querySelector('h1');
 h1.style.color = 'red';

 h1.addEventListener('click', () => {
    if (h1.style.color === 'red') {
        h1.style.color = 'blue';
    } else {
        h1.style.color = 'red';
    }
 })
```

In this example, we:

1. Select the first `<h1>` using `document.querySelector('h1')`.
2. We set the color to red, using `style.color`.
3. Using `addEventListener` to listen `click` event, and provide a callback function which toggles the color.

> Note: These methods aren’t built into the JavaScript language — they come from the browser, which exposes them through the DOM API.

### Creating elements

```
const body = document.querySelector('body');

const p = document.createElement('p');
const text = document.createTextNode('new element');

p.appendChild(text);
body.appendChild(p);

```

Here, we:

1. Select the `body`.
2. Create a new `<p>` and a new text node.
3. Append the text node to the `<p>`, and the `<p>` to the `body`.

### Try it out...

Using JS, try adding a red heading to this HTML:

```
   <div class="heading"></div>
   <p>Some paragraph...</p>
```

<Playground
  lang="js"
  html="<div class='heading'></div><p>Some paragraph...</p>"
/>

## Code challenge
